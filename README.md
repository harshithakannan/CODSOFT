This is my First project as an Intern at Codsoft. 
This task is a project which is a To-Do List application and is useful in helping users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. 
This project aims to create a GUI-based application using Python (I used Tkinter), allowing users to create, delete, and track their to-do lists.
I have also added an extra feature of adding their priority. Where they get to easily find which task is more important than the other.
