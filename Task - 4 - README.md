This is my Third project (Fourth Task) as an Intern at Codsoft. 
This task is to design a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors which has the ability to give the input in the form of an image with either of the options.
This project was created using a GUI-based application in Python (Tkinter).
This project take the input of the user in the form of images (Rock or Scissors or Paper). 
The input of the computer is auto-generated by using the "random library" in python. 
These two inputs are compared and a points table is maintained until the "End Game" button is clicked on. 
If you prefer on continuing the game, we can click on the "Play Again" button.
This project helps the user to play the game efficiently and makes the project user friendly.
