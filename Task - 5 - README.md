This is my Fourth project (Fifth Task) as an Intern at Codsoft. 
This task is to design a Contact Book with the facilities of Creating, Searching, Updating, and Deleting.
This project was created using a GUI-based application in Python (Tkinter).
This project helps in Creating, Updating, Searching and Deleting the necessary contacts. 
We can create a new contact by adding fields (name, phone, email and address) as input and click on the button "Add Contact".
We can search any contact by entering the name of the person and clicking on the button "Search". 
Updation is done by entering the fields int he input boxes and selecting which contact we want to update and change by clicking on the button "Update". 
We can delete by clicking on the name of the person and clicking on the button "Delete".
This project helps the user to maintain a simple contact book online.
