This is my Second project as an Intern at Codsoft. 
This task is to design a simple calculator which has some basic arithmetic operations such as Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Division (/) and Multiplication (*).
This project was created using a GUI-based application in Python (Tkinter).
The user can input two numbers, (either integer or floating point numbers).
Then the user must click on the operation he/she wants to perfom on the two numbers. This results into the calculation between the two numbers in the form of a floating point number.
This project helps the user to perform any preferred operation on the numbers given efficiently.
